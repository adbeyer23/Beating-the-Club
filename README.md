Beating the Club: Predicting Good Loans on LendingClub.com

With 200,000+ rows of loan data from LendingClub.com, I created a random forest model with .92 precision in predicting good loans. This model was put into a flask app in order to quickly predict loan success.

Currently only the flask app is here. The rest of the code is coming soon.
