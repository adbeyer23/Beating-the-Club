Beating the Club: Predicting Good Loans on LendingClub.com

With 200,000+ rows of loan data from LendingClub.com, I created a gradient boosted model with .92 precision in predicting good loans. A similar, more basic model, was put into a flask app in order to quickly predict loan success.

FYI: I did this presentation like a sleazy sales pitch or infomercial-hence the bizarreness of some of the slides.
